<h1>You're all set!</h1>
<p>1. Go to your Wii Menu, click the Wii Button, then Wii Settings, then go to page two and select Internet, then Console Information. Copy the MAC Address shown at the top.<br>2. Go to <a href="https://please.hackmii.com/">https://please.hackmii.com/</a> in your computer's browser<br>3. Select your region. 4.3U is America, 4.3E is Europe, J is Japan, and K is Korea (i'm assuming not north korea).<br>4. Type your MAC Address into the available field.<br>5. Make sure to bundle the Hackmii Installer.<br>6. Verify that you are human and cut your favorite wire. A download should begin.<br>6. Insert your SD Card into your computer.<br>

<br>8. Eject your SD Card and power on the Wii.
<br>9. Insert your SD Card into the Wii. Open the front compartment and you should see a red button and an SD Slot. The Wii makes a ding noise when you insert the SD, so be aware of that.
<br>10. Go to Mail and see if there is a red letter. If there isn't, go back one day. If there still isn't, go forward a day. If there STILL isn't a red letter, keep going back in the Mail until you find it.
<br>11. Once you see the red "Letterbomb", select it with your Wii Remote. It might look daunting, but it's safe, don't worry.
<br>12. Eventually, you should be prompted to press 1 to continue. Do that.
<br>13. Navigate using the Wii Remote's D-Pad and A/B buttons. Install the Homebrew Channel and BootMii (as boot2 if possible, but IOS is fine).
<br>14. Exit the installer. You should now have the Homebrew Channel.</p>
